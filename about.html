      <h2>More Than Construction</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.15rem; max-width:850px;">
        At Argcheeneh Construction, we don’t just build structures — we build trust,
        long-term value, and spaces people are proud to live in. With more than
        <strong>25 years of hands-on experience</strong> and over
        <strong>2,000 residential units built and remodeled</strong>, our work reflects
        decades of learning, refining, and taking pride in doing things the right way.

  <!-- OUR APPROACH -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p style="max-width:900px;">
        We believe the construction experience should feel organized, transparent,
        and collaborative — not stressful. That’s why our process is built around
        planning, communication, and respect for the client’s time, budget, and vision.
      </p>

      <div class="grid" style="margin-top:40px;">
        <div class="card">
          <strong>Plan with Purpose</strong>
          <p>
            Every project starts with clear planning and realistic cost evaluation.
            We take time upfront so the build phase runs smoothly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Build with Discipline</strong>
          <p>
            Our engineering-aware approach ensures structural integrity,
            code compliance, and long-term durability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Deliver with Pride</strong>
          <p>
            We stand behind our work. Attention to detail, clean execution,
            and client satisfaction are non-negotiable.

      <p style="max-width:900px; font-size:1.1rem;">
        We understand that construction is a major investment and a personal decision.
        Our goal is to make the experience clear, respectful, and reassuring —
        from the first conversation to the final walkthrough.
