      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Argcheeneh Construction is a full-service construction and remodeling firm
        with over <strong>25 years of hands-on experience</strong> and more than
        <strong>2,000 residential units built and remodeled</strong> across a wide
        range of markets and project types.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work spans <strong>international projects</strong> as well as high-quality
        residential construction throughout the United States. From custom homes
        and full-scale renovations to carefully executed interior remodels, we bring
        the same level of care, precision, and accountability to every project—no
        matter the size.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <strong>Craftsmanship First</strong>
          <p>
            We believe great construction is felt in the details—how materials meet,
            how spaces flow, and how a finished project stands the test of time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Clear Communication</strong>
          <p>
            Building should never feel confusing or stressful. We prioritize clarity,
            transparency, and honest conversations from planning through completion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Client Experience</strong>
          <p>
            We take pride not only in what we build, but in how our clients feel
            throughout the process. Respect, responsiveness, and follow-through
            are non-negotiable.
          </p>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Experience That Shows</h2>
      <p>
        Our portfolio includes custom residences, multi-unit developments, full
        home renovations, kitchens, bathrooms, and complex structural remodels.
        Each project reflects decades of accumulated knowledge—how to plan
        efficiently, anticipate challenges, and deliver results without cutting corners.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collaborate closely with homeowners, designers, and engineers to ensure
        every decision supports both function and aesthetics. The result is work
        that feels intentional, refined, and built to last.
